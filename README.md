*Travis CI* provides straightforward build automation, is integrated with GitHub and very easy to set up and use.

## Steps to setup automated builds using Travis

- Go to https://travis-ci.com/, *Sign in* using your GitHub account.
- Write a *.travis.yml* file and add it to a GitHub repo that you want Travis to build automatically (after a *push* or accepting a *pull request*). 
  - Templates for how to write the file are available, just choose your language at https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/
